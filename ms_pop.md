# Introduction

Describing the structure of ecological communities requires to know not only
the identity of species, but also their interactions. Because interactions
drive ecological dynamics within communities [@berlow_simple_2009], their
organization will confer certain ecological properties. The structure of
interactions has been described by species interaction networks
[@dunne_network_2006], that is, a mathematical and conceptual representation of
both *species*, and the *interactions* they establish. This view generated
a rich literature primarily focused on how certain mathematical properties of
the network related to the robustness [@dunne_network_2002], productivity
[@duffy_functional_2007], or tolerance to extinction [@memmott_tolerance_2004]
of the community it represents. Although this approach classically focused on
food webs [@ings_ecological_2009], it can be applied equally to all types of
ecological interactions [@kefi_more_2012]. By large, this literature assumes
that, short of changes in local densities due to ecological dynamics, networks
are *static* objects. If two species are known to interact at one location, it
is assumed that they will interact whenever they co-occur [see *e.g.*
@havens_scale_1992]. Recently, it has been established that networks are *dynamic*
objects, that have structured variation in $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$
diversity, due not only to the change of species composition at different
localities, but also to the fact that the same species will interact in
different ways over time or space. Of these sources of variation in networks,
the change of species composition has been addressed by previous
literature [@gravel_trophic_2011;@dattilo_spatial_2013]. However,
because this literature mostly assumes that interactions happen
consistently between species, it is ill-suited to address network
variation as a whole, and needs be supplemented with new concepts and
mechanisms.

In the current paradigm, interactions are established between species. Starting
from empirical observations, expert knowledge, or literature surveys, one can
collect a list of interactions for a given species pool. Several studies used
this approach to extrapolate the structure of networks over space
[@havens_scale_1992;@baiser_geographic_2012], by considering that the network
at *any* location is composed of *all* of the potential interactions known for
this species pool. This stands in stark contrast with recent results showing
that (i) the identity of interacting species varies over space
[@poisot_dissimilarity_2012], and (ii) the dissimilarity is not related to the
dissimilarity in species composition. The current conceptualization of networks
leaves us poorly equipped to understand the causes of this variation, and in
this paper we propose a general research agenda to understand the mechanisms
involved in the variability of species interactions. We propose that future
research on interaction networks be guided by the following principles. First,
at the regional scale, species interactions exists in a probabilistic
state. Second, the probability that two species will interact can be
determined as a function of traits and local abundances. Third,
observations of interactions at local sites are the realizations of
these regional probabilities. This approach is outlined in **Box 1**.
Although this proposal is a major change in the conceptualization of
network structure, we show in this paper that it is well supported by
empirical and theoretical results alike, and will open the way to the
development of predictive approaches integrating over a range of
ecological mechanisms. 

Recent studies on the sensitivity of network structure to environmental change
provide some context for this approach. @menke_plant-frugivore_2012 showed that
the structure of a plant–frugivore network changed along a forest–farmland
gradient. Specifically, at the edges between two habitats, species were on
average less specialized, interacting more evenly with a larger number of
partners, when compared to habitat cores. Even within different forest strata,
differing by proximity to the canopy and visitation by birds, differences in
network structure were observed [@schleuning_specialization_2011].
@eveleigh_fluctuations_2007 demonstrated that outbreaks of the spruce budworm
were associated to changes in the structure of its trophic network, both in
terms of species observed, and their interactions. @poisot_resource_2011 used
a microbial system of hosts and pathogens to study the impact of productivity
gradients on the realization of infection events. When the species were moved
from high to medium to low productivity, some interactions were lost, and some
other were gained. These results suggest that the existence of an interaction
is not only contingent on the presence of the two species involved, but may
also require particular environmental conditions, and perhaps presence of
outside species.

[f:meta]: metaweb.pdf "The metaweb concept"
![An illustration of the metaweb. In its simplest form, the metaweb is the list of all possible species and interactions between them for the system studied. The interactions could be based on observations or inferred from trait values and previous knowledge [@gravel_inferring_2013]. What is observed locally, here at sites 1 and 2, is a *realization* of this metaweb. The realized network differs because of the action of species sorting and other meta-community processes, and local interaction sorting. The two observed networks have different properties, species compositions, and interactions between these species.\label{f:meta}][f:meta]

We argue that there are three broadly-defined classes of mechanisms involved in
determining the realizations of species interactions. First, individuals must
be in high enough local relative abundances to meet (the "neutral" perspective
of interactions). Second, there must be phenological matching between
individuals, so that once encounter took place, the individuals will actually
interact. Finally, the realization of an interaction is regulated by the
surroundings of interacting organisms, and should be studied in the context of
indirect interactions. We examine each of these mechanisms in turn, and show
how they integrate to the proposed statistical framework outlined in **Box 1**.
We propose that our understanding of the structure of interaction networks in
a spatial context, and consequently our ability to predict this structure, will
be increased our attention and methodologies are shifted from a species-centric
perspective to a population-centric one.

# Population dynamics and neutral processes

Over the recent years, the idea of neutrality percolated into the analysis of
the structure of ecological networks, most notably in bipartite networks
[@bluthgen_measuring_2006]. For example, re-analysis of several host–parasite
datasets showed that changes in local species abundances triggers variation in
parasite specificity [@vazquez_species_2005]. Having minimal assumptions about
the distribution of species abundance allows predicting the structure of
trophic interactions [@canard_emergence_2012 ]. In this section, we review
recent studies investigating the consequences of neutral dynamics on the
structure of interaction networks, and show how variations in population size
can lead to interaction turnover.

## The basic processes

For an interaction to happen between individuals from two populations, these
individuals must first meet, then interact. Assuming that two populations
occupy the same locality, and are active at the same time of the day, then the
likelihood of an interaction is roughly proportional to the product of their relative
abundance. This means that individuals from two large populations are more
likely to interact than individuals from two small populations, simply because
their individuals will meet more often. This approach can also be extended to
the prediction of interaction strength
[@bluthgen_measuring_2006;@vazquez_species_2007], *i.e.* how strong the
consequences of the interaction will be. It predicts that locally abundant
species should have more partners, and locally rare species should appear
locally more specialized. In a purely neutral modeli (*i.e.* interactions
happen entirely by chance, although abundance can be not neutral), the
identity of species do not matter, and it becomes easy to understand how this
can lead to a situation where, because species vary regionally in abundance,
the structure of local networks will vary. @canard_emergence_2012 proposed
the term of "neutrally forbidden link" to refer to interactions that are
feasible from a phenologic standpoint, but not realized because of
population size distribution. The identity of these neutrally forbidden
links will vary over time and space, either by stochastic changes in
population sizes, or because population size respond deterministically to
extrinsic drivers. A similar phenomenon was observed by
@poisot_resource_2011. A soil community of bacteria (victims) and
bacteriophages (enemies) was isolated from its natural environment, and all
pairwise interactions were measured along a gradient of decreasing resource
availability. The resulting lower abundance of the bacteria significantly
decreased the encounter probability of the two species and thereby the
network structure. This resulted in a strong link turnover, with some
species being able to interact in the resource-rich environment, but not in
the resource-poor ones.

## Benefits for network analysis

It is important to understand how local variations in abundance, wether neutral
or not, cascades to the structure of interaction networks. Simple statistical
models can be used to quantify the effect of population sizes on local
interaction occurrence or strength [see *e.g.* @krishna_neutral-niche_2008 and
Box 1]. These models can be further extrapolated to remove the contribution of
neutrality to link strength, allowing us to work directly on the interactions
as they are determined by traits. This allows comparing the variation of
neutral and non-neutral components of network structure over space and time. To
do so, it is important the future sampling of interaction networks (i) are
replicated and (ii) include measurements of population sizes. An additional
benefit is that these data will help refining neutral theory:
@wootton_field_2005 made the point that deviations of empirical communities
from neutral predictions were most often explained by species trophic
interactions, which are notoriously absent from the original formulation of the
theory. Merging the two views will increase our explanatory power, and provide
new ways to test neutral theory in interactive communities. This also offers
a new opportunity, namely to complete the integration of network structure with
population dynamics. To date, most studies focused on the consequence of one
species having a particular position within a food web on the dynamics of its
biomass or abundance [@brose_allometric_2006; @berlow_simple_2009]. Adopting
this neutral perspective allows to go back, in that the abundance of a species
will also dictate its position in the network: changes in abundance can lead to
gained or lost interactions, and these changes in abundance are in part caused
by existing interactions. For this reason, there is a potential to link species
and interactions dynamics, and more importantly, to do so in a way which
accounts for the feedback effects. From a practical point of view, this
requires repeated sampling of a system through time, so that changes in
relative abundances can be related to changes in interaction strength
[@yeakel_probabilistic_2012]. Importantly, adopting this view will force to
reconsider the causal relationship between resource dynamics and interaction
strength; in a neutral context, both are interdependant, thus potentially
complexifying our view of the feedbacks between them.

# Traits matching in space and time

Once individuals meet, wether they will interact is determined by an array of
behavioral, phenotyic, cultural aspects, that can convenientyl be refered to as
"trait-based procsse". Two populations can interact when their traits values
allow it, *e.g.* viruses are able to overcome host resistance, predators can
capture the preys, trees provide enough shading for shorter grasses to grow.
Non-matching traits will effectively prevent the existence of an interaction,
as demonstrated by @olesen_missing_2011. Under this perspective, the
existence of interactions can be mapped onto trait values, and consequently
interaction networks will vary along with variation in local trait
distribution. In this section, we review how trait-based processes impact
network structure and can create variation, and the perspective they open
for an evolutionary approach.

## The basic processes

There are evidences that at the species level, interaction partners are
selected on the grounds of matching trait values. Random networks built on
these rules exhibit realistic structural properties [@williams_simple_2000].
However, trait values vary from population to population within species, and so
it is expected that the local interactions will be contingent upon trait
distributions (\autoref{f:traits}). The fact that the niche of species can
appear large if it is the aggregation of narrow but differenciated individual
or population niches is now well established
[@devictor_defining_2010;@bolnick_ecology_2003], and reinforced the need to
understand intra-specific trait variation to describe the structure and
dynamics of communities [@bolnick_why_2011]. This notion is yet, however, to
percolate the literature on network structure, despite an immediate
consequence: a species appearing generalist at the regional scale, ca be
specialized in each of the patches it occupies. There are several examples of
intraspecific trait variation resulting in extreme interaction tunrover.
A particularly spectacular example is described by @ohba_field_2011: a giant
waterbug is able to get hold of, and eventually consume, juveniles from
a turtle species. @choh_predator-prey_2012 demonstrated through behavioral
assays that preys which evaded predation when young, were more likely to
predate juvenile predators, than the "naive" individuals: the past interactions
shaped behavioral traits that alter the network structure over time. These
examples show that trait-based effects on networks can be observed even in the
absence of genotypic variation (although we discuss this in the next section).
In this perspective, the existence of an interaction is an emergent property of
the trait distribution of local populations: variations in one or both of these
distribution, regardless of the mechanism involved (development, selection,
plasticity), is likely to alter the interaction. Importantly, when
interaction-driving traits are under environmental forcing (for example, body
size is expected to be lower in warm environments,
@angilletta_temperature_2004), there can be covariation between
environmental conditions and the occurence of interactions.
@woodward_climate_2012 demonstrate that changes in food-web structure happen at
the same time as changes in body mass in experimental macrocosms. Integrating
trait variation over spatial or temporal extents is now central if we are to
understand network variation and response to environmental change.

[f:traits]: traits.pdf "Traits and populations"
![Panel **A** represents the interactions between different populations (circles) of four species, identified by the boundaries of their morphospaces (dashed lines). This network is mostly made of linear food chains, and has one generalist consumer. When aggregated at the species level however, as shown in **B**, it becomes a "diamond" food-web, with different dynamical consequences. Because the trait values of populations within a species differ, each indivudal population can interact differently than the species it belongs to.\label{f:traits}.][f:traits]

## Benefits for network analysis

Linking spatial and temporal trait variation with network variation will help
identify the mechanistic basis of network dissimilarity. From a sampling point
of view, having enough data require that when interaction are recorded, they
are coupled with traits measurements. These measurements cannot merely be
extracted from reference database, because as we exposed in the previous
section, interactions are driven by *local* trait values, and their matching
across populations from different species. Within the statistical framework
presented in Box 1, we can expect that (i) network variability at the
*regional* scale will be dependent on the variation of population traits
values, and (ii) variation between any series of networks will be dependant by
the *covariance* between species traits. This approach, although requiring
important quantities of data to test, could allow inferring an *a priori*
estimate of network variation. This new generation of data will help relate the
variation of network structure to variation of environmental conditions.
@price_macroevolutionary_2003 shows how specific biomechanic response to water
input in shrubs can have pleiotropic effects on traits involved in the
interaction with insects. In this sytem, the difference in network structure
can be explained because (i) traits values determine the existence of an
interaction, and (ii) environmental features determine trait values.
Accumulating empirical evidences will increase our ability to come-up with such
mechanistic narratives. At a larger temporal scales, current distribution of
traits also reflects past evolutionary history
[@diniz-filho_macroecology_2008]. This offers an opportunity to approach the
evolutionary dynamics and variation of networks. Correlations between traits of
different species, and between traits and fitness, drive coevolutionary
dynamics [@gomulkiewicz_hot_2000;@nuismer_coevolution_2003]. Both of these vary
over space and time [@thompson_geographic_2005], which creates patchiness in
the processes and outcomes of coevolution. Additionally, trait structure and
traits correlations are disrupted by migration
[@gandon_host-parasite_2008;@burdon_coevolution_2009]. Developping an
understanding of how ecological and evolutionary trait dynamics affect network
structure will provide a mechanistic basis to our interpretation of the
historical signal found in contemporary network structures
[@eklof_relevance_2011; @baskerville_spatial_2011].

# Beyond direct interactions

In this section, we argue that although networks offer a direct access to
direct interactions, there is potential in adressing indirect effects on the
existence of interactions too. A direct interaction originates in the
"physical" interaction of two species, and as we argued before, these can be
modified by species traits or local relative abundances. For example,
predation, or pollination, are instances of direct interactions.
Indirect interactions, on the other hand, are established "at
a distance", either through cascading effet (herbivorous species
compete with insect laying eggs on plants), or through physical
mediation by the environment (bacterial exudates increase the
bio-disponbility of iron for all bacterial species; plants with
large foliage provide shade for smaller species). As we discuss
in this section, the fact that interactions are indirectly affected by
the presence of other species (i) have relevance for the variation of
interaction network structure, and (ii) can be studied using classical
network theory formalism.

## The basic processes

Several authors [@golubski_modifying_2011] showed that biotic interactions
themselves interact. Because the outcome of an interaction ultimately affects
local abudances (on ecological times) and population trait structure (over
evolutionary times), all interactions happenning within a community will
impact one another. Far from meaning that pairwise-centered approaches are
bound to fail, this calls for a larger scale approach accounting for indirect
effects. The occurrence or absence of a biotic interaction can either affect
either the realization of other interactions (thus affecting the "interaction"
component of network $\beta$-diversity), or the presence of other
species, as we will illustrate below. There are several well-documented
examples of the presence of an interaction allowing new interactions to happen
(opportunistic pathogens have a greater success of infection on hosts which are
already immunocompromised by previous infections @olivier_are_2012), or
conversely preventing them (a resident symbiont decreases the infection
probability of a new pathogen
[@koch_socially_2011;@heil_protective_2003]). In both cases, the driver
of interaction turnover is the patchiness of species distribution, emphasizing
why the two concepts ought to be integrated. Variation in interaction structure
can happen through both cascading and environmental effects:
@singer_disentangling_2004 show that caterpillars change the proportion of
different plant species in their diet, favoring low quality items to load on
chemical compounds which are toxic for their parasitoids. However, low quality
food result in birds having a greater impact on caterpillar populations
[@singer_tritrophic_2012]. It is noteworthy that in this example, the existence
of an interaction will affect both the strength, and impact, of other
interactions. In terms of their effects on network $\beta$-diversity, indirect
effects are thus likely to act on components of dissimilarity. A common feature
of the examples mentionned in this part is that pinpointing the exact mechanism
through which species interaction interfere requires most often a good
knowledge of the system's natural history. In their current state, ecological
networks most often account for a single type of interactions [although new
datasets are starting to emerge, *e.g.* @mouritsen_food_2011 and
@zander_food_2011]. Our ability to understand these complex phenomenon will be
contingent on our ability to (i) integrate different types of interactions in
ecological networks [@goudard_nontrophic_2008;@kefi_more_2012], and (ii) to
provide rich meta-data regarding the identity of each node in the network.

## Benefits for network analysis

Accounting for the relationships between biotic interactions can be a powerful
explanation for species co-occurrence. A recent experimental work by
@sanders_indirect_2012 showed that some predators species can only be maintained
if another predator species is present, which regulates a competitively superior
prey, hence allowing prey coexistence. These effects involving several species
and several types of interactions across trophic levels are complex [and for
this reason, have been deemed unpredictible in the past, @tack_can_2011], and
can only be understood by comparing communities in which different species are
present/absent.

To better understand these effects, it is important that several
networks with similar species compositions are sampled. Assuming that
interactions are present is obviously not enough, and the data needed to
characterize these mechanism need to include a precise measure of
interaction strength between each species. It is true that such data are
orders of magnitude more difficult to gather than literature surveys or
expert knowledge, but they are the only way to go beyond the current
paradigm of seeing networks as mostly a collection of pairwise
interactions.

% DG: Isn't co-occurrence also important to other processes? It will contribute to the turnover of interactions under all three processes. It is only through this one though that it will affect the interaction strenght (beta link). 

From a biogeographic standpoint, it require that we develop a theory based on
interaction co-occurrence, in addition to the current knowledge encompassing
only species co-occurrence. @araujo_using_2011 and @allesina_competitive_2011
introduced the idea tha competitive interactions can leave a trace in species
co-occurence network. It is now time to apply this logic to other types of
interactions. In part, this can be done through the re-analysis of already
existing datasets, although the statistical foundation of such a work is still
mostly unknown [@thuiller_road_2013].

% DG: I dropped here, there is considerable work to be done above before going back to the conclusions. We'll talk more about it. There is interesting stuff though below that might worth being moving up (e.g. the effect of the environment on the beta)

# Conclusions

The notion of “species interaction networks” is an epistemological
obstacle shifting our focus away from the level of organization at which
most of the relevant processes happen --- populations. In order to make
reliable predictions on the structure of networks, we need to understand
what triggers variability in ecological interactions. In this contribution,
we outlined that there were direct (abundance-related, and trait-based)
and indirect (biotic modifiers, indirect effects of co-ocurence) effects to
account for. The relative importance of each of these factors, and how exactly
the affect the probability of establishing an interaction, are most-likely
system-specific; nonetheless, we propose a unified mathematical approach to
better understand them.

At the moment, the field is data-limited. Despite the existence
of several spatially or temporally replicated datasets [*e.g.*
@schleuning_specialization_2011 ; @schleuning_specialization_2012 ;
@menke_plant-frugivore_2012], it is rare that all relevant informations
have been measured. However, we recently showed that only a reasonably
small subset of data is enough to draw inferences at larger scales
[@gravel_inferring_2013]. Paradoxically, as tempting as it may be to sample
a network in its entirety, the goal of establishing global predictions might
be better furthered by characterising extremely well a more modest number of
interactions. Assuming that there are indeed statistical invariants in the
rules of interactions, this information will allow to make predictions on
the structure of the networks. Better still, this approach has the potential
to substantially strengthen our understanding of the relationships between
traits and neutral effects. @bluthgen_what_2008 claim that the impact of
traits distribution on network structure can be inferred simply by removing
the impact of neutrality (population densities), based on the idea that many
rare links were instances of sampling artifacts. As illustrated in Box 2,
their approach is of limited generality, as the abudance of a species can
be directly driven by trait-environment matching. 

With the accumulation of data, these approaches will rapidly expand our ability
to predict the re-wiring of networks under environmental change. The effect
of environmental change is expected to occur because (i) population sizes
will be affected by the change and (ii) either plastic or adaptive responses
will shoft or disrupt the traits distributions. The framework proposed in
Box 1 allows to generate new probabilities of interactions under different
scenarios. Ultimately, being explicit on the trait-abundance-interaction
feedback will provide a better understanding of short-term and long-term
dynamics of interaction networks. We illsutrate this in Fig. [fig:synth].

# Boxes

**Box 1: A mathematical framework for population level interactions**

In this contribution, we propose that at the population level, the occurrence
(and intensity) of ecological interactions relies on several factors, including
relative local abundances and local trait distribution.  It is important to
tell apart these different factors, so as to better disentangle neutral and
niche processes. We propose that these different effects can adequately be
partitionned using the model,

$$\mathbf{A}_{ij} \propto \left[\mathcal{N}(i,j)\times\mathcal{T}(i,j)\right]+\epsilon \,,$$

wherein $\mathcal{N}$ is a function giving the probability that species $i$
and $j$ interact *based on their relative abudances*, and $\mathcal{T}$
is a function giving the *per encounter* probability that species $i$
and $j$ interact *based on their trait values*. The term $\epsilon$
accounts for all higher-order effects, such as indirect interactions,
local impact of environmental conditions on the interaction, and impact of
co-occuring species. Both of these functions can take any form needed. In
several papers, $\mathcal{N}(i,j)$ was expressed as $\mathbf{n}_i\times
\mathbf{n}_j$, where $\mathbf{n}$ is a vector of relative abudances
[@canard_emergence_2012;@vazquez_species_2007]. The expression of $\mathcal{T}$
can in most cases be derived from mechanistic hypotheses about the
observation. For example, @gravel_inferring_2013 used the niche model
of @williams_simple_2000 to draw interactions, with the simple rule that
$\mathcal{T}(i,j) = 1$ if $i$ can consume $j$ based on allometric rules, and
$0$ otherwise. Following @rohr_modeling_2010, the expression of $\mathcal{T}$
can be based on latent variables rather than actual traits values. In a
variance partitioning context, this apparently simple formulation will
allow to understand, at the level of individual interactions, the relative
importance of trait-based and density-dependent processes. Most importantly,
it will allow to predict (i) how each of these components will vary over
space, and (ii) how the structure of the network will be affected by *e.g.*
changes in trait distributions or local abundances.

This model can further be extended in a spatial context, as

$$\mathbf{A}_{ijx} \propto \left[\mathcal{N}_x(i_x,j_x)\times\mathcal{T}_x(i_x,j_x)\right]+\epsilon_{ijx} \,,$$

in which the $x$ index denotes sites, and $i_x$ is the population of species
$i$ at site $x$. In this formulation, the $\epsilon$ term can be made to
include the spatial variation of interaction between $i$ and $j$ over sites,
and the covariance between the observed presence of this interaction and the
occurence of species $i$ and $j$. Most importantly, this model differs in
that each site $x$ is characterized by a set of functions ${\mathcal{N}_x,
\mathcal{T}_x}$, that may not be the same for all sites considered. For
example, the same predator can prefer different prey items in different
locations, which will require to use a different shape for $\mathcal{T}$
across  the range of locations. In @gravel_inferring_2013, we show that it is
possible to derive robust approximation for the $\mathcal{T}$ function even
with incomplete set of data, which gives hopes that this framework can be
applied even when all species informations are not known at all sites (which,
for most realistic systems, will be an unrealistic requirement). The strength
of these models is that they can be used in a variance partitionning approach
(in which case they measure the multiplicative and additive contributions
of abundance, traits, and other factors), or within dynamical simulations,
to generate realistic rewiring of the networks as a function of environmental
changes.

\newpage

**Box 2: Why population-level (or individual-level) interactions are critically important**

As noted in the main text, most studies of ecological networks---particularly
food webs---regard the adjacency matrix $\mathbf{A}$ as a fixed entity that
specifies observable interactions on the basis of whether two species co-occur
or not. Given this assumption, there is a long history, dating back at least
to the Lotka-Volterra model, of trying to understand how the strength or
organization of these interactions influence the dynamic behavior of species
abundance. Often, such models take the form

$$\frac{dN_i}{dt} = N_i \left(g_i - \sum_{j \ne i} \alpha_{ij} A_{ij} N_j \right) \,,$$

where $g_i$ is the growth rate of species $i$ (and could, in principle,
depend on all other species' abundances $\mathbf{N}$) and $\alpha_{ij}$
is the strength of the effect of $j$ on $i$. It is important to note that,
in this or just about any related model, direct species-species interaction
can influence species' abundances but their abundances *never* feedback and
influence the *per capita* interactions (although they do affect the *realized*
interactions, which are here defined by $\alpha_{ij}N)iN_j$). Moreover,
the only manner in which non-directly-interacting species could "influence"
the abundances of other species is via indirect mechanisms like apparent or
exploitative competition.

More recently, there have been multiple attempts to approach the problem from
the other way around. Namely, to understand how factors such as species'
abundance and/or trait distributions influence the occurrence of the
interactions themselves (see Box 1). One drawback to the standard approach
here, however, is that it still depends on the fundamental assumption that
the observation of any interaction $A_{ij}$ is a function of the properties
of species $i$ and $j$ alone. Since dynamic models can demonstrate quite
clearly that non-interacting species can alter each others' abundances, this
is a surprisingly pertinent inconsistency between the two approaches. Such
a simplification *does* increase the analytical tractability of the problem,
but there is little if any guarantee that it is scientifically or ecologically
correct. In our opinion, the "higher-effects" term $\epsilon$ in the models
presented in Box 1 is the one with the least straightforward expectations,
but the most important to accurately describe as its encompasses all of
these indirect effects.

It could also be argued that a similar problem arises in the typical
statistical framework for predicting interaction occurrence. Often, attempts
are made to "decompose" interactions into the component that is explained by
species' abundances and the component explained by species' traits (e.g.,
Box 1). Just like how the underlying functions could vary across sites,
there should also be interplay between species' abundances and traits,
in the same way that we have outlined the feedback between interactions
and species' abundances. What's more, given the increasing evidence for
the evolutionary role of species-species interactions in explaining extant
biodiversity and their underlying traits, any framework which depends on
the relative independence of these different phenomenon is likely starting
from an overly reductionist perspective. Importantly, we will have *no*
hope in successfully piecing apart the effects of each of these drivers,
or robustly assessing the degree to which they are interrelated, without
adopting a broader perspective on ecological- network data that is fully
replicated at the site, population, or individual level.
